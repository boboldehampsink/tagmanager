DEPRECATED - Tag Manager plugin for Craft CMS
=================

Plugin that allows you to edit and delete tags.

Features:
 - Create tags (with custom fields)
 - Edit tags (with custom fields)
 - Delete tags
 - Has hook to modify element index html, table attributes and sortable attributes
 
Important:
The plugin's folder should be named "tagmanager"

Deprecated
=================

With the release of Craft 3 on 4-4-2018, this plugin has been deprecated. You can still use this with Craft 2 but you are encouraged to use (and develop) a Craft 3 version. At this moment, I have no plans to do so.
